### Usage:

1. **Download Executable:**
   - Download the pre-built executable file `HTTPServer.exe` from the provided link.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Ensure your SSL certificate (`cert.pem`) and private key (`key.pem`) are placed in the same directory as the executable.
   - Update the `config.json` file located in the `db` directory with your server details (server name, port, meta).

3. **Running the Server:**
   - Double-click the `HTTPServer.exe` file to run the server.
   - The server will start listening on `0.0.0.0:443`.
